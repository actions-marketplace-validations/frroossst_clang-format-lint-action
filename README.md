# Setup

Copy this starter file to your .github/workflows folder and modify as you see git

NOTE: This checks out the repo, formats using clang-tidy and commits to the repo, disable actions as 
you see fit

# Problem

Couldn't find a github actions solutions and it was too complicated to setup a docker image so a simple
bash solution

# Future

Will create a proper docker image and github actions that'll be deployed on marketplace
